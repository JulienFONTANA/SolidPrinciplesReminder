SOLID Principles reminder with Dependency Injection using Ninject

## Why this Kata ?
I wanted to have fun, I had a little time, and voil√†!

## Why C# ?
It's my main programmation language, and I like it quite a lot.
C# standard 4.7.2 used here.

## What is Dependency Injection ?
Dependency Injection allows for a framework (Ninject here) to supply and replace classic object creation and can be very powerful.
I don't even scratch the surface here.

## Can I clone this repo ?
Sure, have fun !
